## âš™ Python environment setup with Conda

```bash
conda create -n opengt python=3.10
conda activate opengt

pip install pytorch=2.5 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124

pip install torch_geometric

pip install pyg_lib torch_scatter torch_sparse torch_cluster torch_spline_conv -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.5.0+cu124.html

# RDKit is required for OGB-LSC PCQM4Mv2 and datasets derived from it.  
conda install openbabel fsspec rdkit

pip install pytorch-lightning yacs torchmetrics
pip install performer-pytorch
pip install tensorboardX
pip install ogb
pip install wandb
pip install pymetis

conda clean --all
```

## ðŸš€ Running Experiments

### 1. Activate Environment

First, activate the project environment:

```bash
conda activate opengt
```

---

### 2. Run a Single Experiment

Use `main.py` along with a configuration file to launch an experiment. Configuration files are stored in:

```
configs/<ModelName>/<DatasetName-ModelName>.yaml
```

#### Example: Run DIFFormer on Cora (3 runs)

```bash
python main.py --cfg configs/DIFFormer/cora-DIFFormer.yaml --repeat 3
```

Results will be saved automatically to:

```
results/DIFFormer/cora-DIFFormer/
```

---

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning

To perform grid search on hyperparameters, use the provided `run_batch.sh` script and corresponding grid files under the `grids/` directory.


```bash
bash run_batch.sh
```

Please note that the grid file and the configuration file names should be modified in the script.

Each line of the grid file should be written in the following format:

```text
<Config parameter name> <Display name> <List of possible values>
```

For example:

```text
gt.layers nlayer [1,2,3,4]
gt.aggregate agg ['add', 'cat']
gt.dropout dropout [0.2, 0.5, 0.8]
```

This will explore all parameter combinations defined in the relevant grid configuration.

---

### 4. Aggregating Results

To summarize and aggregate results from multiple runs:

```bash
python agg_test.py
```

This script collects results across seeds and outputs averaged performance metrics with standard deviations in to a `.csv` file.
